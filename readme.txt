1.Suppose you are in the folder 'assignment1' containing the code.
  Our code expect that the trace file is present in : '../traces' . 
  For example the 'File'(name of the folder) is the folder containing
  two sub folder i.e traces and  assignment1(code containing folder).
2.To compile the code for question 1 :
	run the following code 
				$ g++  ques1.cpp  -o  ques1 
3. To execute  the code for question 1 :
	 for example  just write gcc(as the first argument, if the trace 
         file named as 'gcc.log_l1misstrace' ) and 2( as the second argument 
	 indicating the number of part of that trace file). 
	 run the following code 
				$ ./ques1 gcc 2 
4.To compile the code for question 2 part a :
	run the following code 
				$ g++  lru.cpp  -o  lru 
5. To execute  the code for question 2 part a :
	 for example  just write gcc(as the first argument, if the trace 
         file named as 'gcc.log_l1misstrace' ) and 2( as the second argument 
	 indicating the number of part of that trace file). 
	 run the following code 
				$ ./lru gcc 2 
6.To compile the code for question 2 part b :
	run the following code 
				$ g++  belady.cpp  -o  belady 
7. To execute  the code for question 2 part a :
	 for example  just write gcc(as the first argument, if the trace 
         file named as 'gcc.log_l1misstrace' ) and 2( as the second argument 
	 indicating the number of part of that trace file). 
	 run the following code 
				$ ./belady gcc 2
